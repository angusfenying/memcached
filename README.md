# Memcached-Win64

## Introduction

Memcached-Win64 is special edition of memcached,
for Windows x64 platform. It's lack of following
features:

* SASL
* Latest connections management (using that of v1.4.5)

Because it's an alpha version, so I can't promise
its stability. If you found any bugs, you can post
the feedback by mailing to
